# A simple genai application

Following the first Kisumu GDG event, Idecided to put into practice what I had learnt. This is the result of what I learnt in that event.

## usage

Clone into your machine and get into the root folder:

    $git clone https://github.com/oduortoni/genai.git
    $cd genai

Navigate to https://aistudio.google.com/ to generate an API key (ensure that you are signed into your google acount to be able to access this). Save your api key into a new file under the name ".env". inside it, save the api key as shown:

    GENAI_KAPI_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>

Run the project and be patient. It takes a while to get back the results:

    $python app.py
